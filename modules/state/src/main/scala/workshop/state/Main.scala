 * State monad demo
 *
 * You can use this main function for checking how state function work in action.
 *
 * Here you can see, how State objects can be combined (chained) together using for-comprehension.
 *
 * Feel free to play around with those, as understanding of State will become useful when we learn next powerful
 * abstraction - Free.
