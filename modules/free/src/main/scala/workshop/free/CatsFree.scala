/*
  * Free exercises - Cats
  *
  * 1. Simple free operations
  *
  * In the first exercise we'll try to build free DSLs in the simplest possible way. Such DSLs will be pretty
  * troublesome to combine into bigger, more powerful DSLs, but they should give us some intuition into how free works.
  *
  * 2. Composable free
  *
  * In our next exercise we will modify Ops to make DSL composable. With that our 2 DSLs could be merged together into
  * something resembling our intended program. Our first attempt will use Id - we can think of it as a transparent
  * wrapper type. It can be used each time, code expects parametrized type and we don't need to wrap values int anything
  * in particular.
