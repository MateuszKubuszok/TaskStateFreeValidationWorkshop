/**
 * Validation exercise - Cats
 *
 * In this exercise our goal will be very a simple validation of several simple inputs.
 *
 * In our application will read a program configuration (display accuracy, data source), next action to perform in
 * the main loop, converted currencies and amount of money to convert.
 *
 * Since we want to (potentially) store more than one error message, we will prefer ValidatedNel. We might use test
 * in order to verify correctness of our functions.
 *
 * Suggested imports:
 *
 * $ - [[cats.data.Validated]] - functions like
 * $ - [[cats.data.ValidatedNel]]
 * $ - [[cats.syntax.cartesian._]] - for access to applicative builder
